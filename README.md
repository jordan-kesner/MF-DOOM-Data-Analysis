# A Data Scientist’s Approach to Music: MF DOOM’s Discography  

This project analyzes the discography of MF DOOM using data science techniques. By combining APIs, web scraping, natural language processing, and visualization, the project explores patterns in lyrics, themes, and collaborations to provide new perspectives on DOOM’s artistry.  

---

## Project Objectives  
- Collect and clean lyrics and metadata from the Genius API and web scraping sources.  
- Apply natural language processing (NLP) to analyze vocabulary, rhyme density, and recurring themes.  
- Visualize patterns across albums and collaborations to illustrate DOOM’s artistic development.  

---

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Data Collection:** Genius API, BeautifulSoup, requests  
- **NLP & Analysis:** NLTK, spaCy, TF-IDF, clustering  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

---

## Features  
- **Vocabulary Analysis:** Word frequency, rhyme schemes, and lyrical density across albums.  
- **Topic Modeling:** Identification of recurring themes using clustering and NLP techniques.  
- **Collaboration Network:** Graph-based analysis of DOOM’s artistic collaborations over time.  
- **Visual Storytelling:** Charts and plots that communicate findings in an accessible way.  

---

## Results and Takeaways  
- **High Vocabulary Density:** MF DOOM consistently used a larger and more diverse vocabulary than typical hip-hop benchmarks, reflecting his reputation for wordplay and complex lyricism.  
- **Recurring Themes:** Topic modeling revealed motifs such as villainy, identity, food, and pop culture references, showing how DOOM reinforced his artistic persona across albums.  
- **Collaboration Patterns:** Network analysis highlighted clusters of frequent collaborators (e.g., Madlib, Danger Mouse) and showed how DOOM’s partnerships shifted over different phases of his career.  
- **Album-Level Evolution:** Early projects displayed more straightforward rhyme patterns, while later works incorporated denser rhyme schemes and more experimental structures.  
- **Quantitative Storytelling:** The project illustrates how cultural analysis can benefit from data science, turning subjective assessments of artistry into measurable, visualized insights.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how data science methods can be applied outside traditional domains, transforming music and culture into structured data for exploration and storytelling. By analyzing MF DOOM’s body of work, the project provides both technical insights into NLP and visualization techniques, as well as cultural insights into one of hip-hop’s most influential artists.
